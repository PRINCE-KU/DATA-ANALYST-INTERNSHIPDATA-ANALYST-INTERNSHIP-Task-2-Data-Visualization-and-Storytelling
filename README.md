✅ 1. What is the importance of data visualization?
Answer:
Data visualization helps to understand complex data quickly. It turns numbers into charts and graphs so we can see patterns, trends, and outliers easily. It makes data easy to explain to others and helps in better decision-making.

✅ 2. When do you use a pie chart vs a bar chart?
Answer:

Use a pie chart when you want to show percentage or proportion (like sales share by region).

Use a bar chart when you want to compare values between different items (like sales by product or state).

✅ 3. How do you make visualizations more engaging?
Answer:

Use clear and simple charts.

Add colors wisely to highlight key points.

Use filters and slicers for interaction.

Add titles, tooltips, and labels for better understanding.

Tell a story or show the insight behind the chart.

✅ 4. What is data storytelling?
Answer:
Data storytelling means using visuals and insights to explain the meaning behind data. It combines data, visuals, and a message to help the audience understand the "what," "why," and "what next" in the data.

✅ 5. How do you avoid misleading visualizations?
Answer:

Always label your charts clearly.

Start your y-axis at zero (if comparing sizes).

Don’t use too many colors or fancy effects.

Show the full data range, not just a part.

Be honest—don’t hide negative trends or outliers.

✅ 6. What are best practices in dashboard design?
Answer:

Keep it clean and simple.

Show important KPIs at the top.

Use the right chart for the right data.

Limit the number of visuals on one page.

Make it interactive with filters.

Add titles and tooltips to guide users.

✅ 7. What tools have you used for visualization?
Answer:
I have used:

Power BI for dashboards and interactive reports.

Tableau for visual analytics.

Excel for simple charts and pivot tables.
I can also use Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for coding-based visualizations.

## ✅ Conclusion

This dashboard simplifies Adidas' sales performance into a clean, visual report that highlights opportunities and trends across categories, locations, and channels. It demonstrates how data visualization helps convert raw numbers into strategic insights.
